This week has been super busy. We’ve welcomed some new team members as we continue to improve and develop Hystreet to better serve our agents, and what better way to help agents by having more estate agents in the Hystreet team!
<!-- more -->
Jay Duffy joins us from Countrywide and he will be helping agents to explore and understand the best way to offer choice with Hystreet. The work and improvements continue as we try to build exactly what high street agents need, I must say its bloody hard work, but I love seeing our agents win their first instruction using the system, every time that happens it reinforces our drive to get all high street agents using our technology to thrive.

In estate agency the term ‘feedback’ is used to describe the helpful information or criticism regarding a property from an individual, communicated to the agent and in turn the seller (or directly to the seller) who can then use that information to adjust and improve current and future state of the property in question.

In all my years, the one thing I have always insisted on is to get feedback from each and every viewing, and I would always obtain the feedback from the viewers at the end outside and away from the sellers, as quite early on I realised that the approving nods and the positive sounds viewers made on a viewing when the owners were around were largely false. Was this because we are a nation of bullsh**ers? No, quite the opposite. It turns out its because of our polite British sensibilities. As a nation we would rather lie and fake interest to the seller than upset or offend by being honest, I consider this in the same vein as queuing (another British institution). As someone who has travelled a lot, its these manners that make a person appreciate our culture of dignified manners. In Dubai, Germany and more recently in Bulgaria I ended up confronting queue jumpers and frankly I didn’t care about their nationality or cultural background it’s simply a case of what’s right is right.

(RANT OVER)

There is a downside to our politeness; When it comes to viewings houses is that it leaves the seller feeling positive and the agent is usually left to deliver the bad news. As estate agents we must remember that all feedback is good feedback, as it lets us address the issues that maybe we see but without the validation of half a dozen viewers would get largely ignored by the sellers. This feedback will almost always show a pattern, such as ‘the price is too high’, ‘needs too much work’ etc. As professional agents the idea of ‘list it and leave it’ is commercial suicide. Having sold a property with an online agent a couple of years ago to see what all the fuss was about I was struck by how simply and clearly they presented the feedback, I was also disappointed by their lack of effort to go beyond merely showing the text fields displaying each viewer’s comments. As most agents know it’s far more powerful to not just show the feedback but also to break the feedback down and offer suggestions and actions that go towards remedying the issues. That’s why when we built Hystreet I made sure that the feedback was easily visible in an easy to understand and meaningful way allowing agents to see trends and suggest the best course of action for their clients.

Good feedback also helps the agents to achieve a balance of power with certain sellers. We have all come across sellers who don’t see the faults in their property and give an exaggerated value to minor features of their property, (If I had a penny for every time I heard “but ours has the biggest plot” or “this one was the show home” …) to these sellers the fact their property isn’t selling isn’t due to anything except your failing as an agent. This is where third party feedback from viewers is key, many a time I have had to put Mr Seller in his place by reeling off feedback that all pointed to the fact that his property needed x, y, and z doing to it to justify the price. These are never easy conversations to have, however they are made a lot easier when you have the feedback. A lot of agents think feedback is just from those who have viewed the property, that’s not true, another key feature we are building into Hystreet is the ability to record feedback from registered buyers when you speak to them or match them to a property, now this feedback comes in really useful when the property isn’t getting any interest at all, don’t just rely on the vanilla ‘it’s had x amount of clicks on Rightmove and y amount of views on Zoopla.’ The key here is to leverage real feedback to help the client adjust their expectations or remedy the issues raised. Overall when I’m asked about the differences between a good agent and a crappy one its these little details that matter, something as simple as feedback can do so much for your relationship with your client and also to increase the saleability of the property in question.

I saw this from Henry Pryor this week and I felt it was particularly interesting:

Though I think he is bang on in the case of many agents still stuck in the past refusing to change with the industry, I must stress there are equally a large amount of really smart, proactive and frankly pioneering agents out there. But I think I’m spoiled as I meet the most switched on agents with my work at Hystreet, all of our clients and even those considering our product have already demonstrated acceptance of the change in the industry and are making the best steps to evolve. These are interesting times.
Next time I will be giving my thoughts around automation and its role in estate agency.
