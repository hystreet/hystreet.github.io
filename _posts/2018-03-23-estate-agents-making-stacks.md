My time snowboarding has come to an end. This week has been one based around pondering, when I set out on this journey my mission was clear: To build an “independent genuinely high-tech estate agency platform with a core interest in the agent and not in their data”.  I would be really keen to hear from you all whether you value the idea of an independent company that’s run by agents for agents or if other things are more important to you when it comes to selecting a product for your tech stack.

Tech stack? If you’re in tech, you’ve most definitely have heard the phrase. But for the rest of us mere mortals what does this jargon mean?
<!--more-->

Put simply, if you are building a house you don’t start with the windows or the light fittings. You would start with the foundations and footings to make sure you have a solid base on which to build the rest of the house, right? Well, your tech stack is essentially that, but it extends beyond just the foundation and acts as a core on which to hang off other pieces – a bit like steel work or timber work in a house.

In tech the stack is really important. It serves a really core function to any program or app, in modern estate agency however it is becoming more and more important, so understanding your estate agency’s technology stack is important for the success of your business and may even be the difference between survival and extinction. In estate agency our tech stack is considerably simpler than our tech counterparts, in my view an estate agency tech stack is the tools, software and apps we use to help us conduct our day to day business.

“Why is this important? I’m an estate agent I have a website, email and advertise on portals. Isn’t this enough?”
Firstly, its worth asking the following questions: Why do you have a website? Why do you use email? and why are you advertising on portals? The answer will almost always be because it saves us time & money or because clients expect it. Any business must place their product or service where their target market is – that’s why we list with Rightmove and begrudgingly pay their ever-increasing fees, because when all is said and done that is where the buyers are looking! Tomorrow’s buyers expect even more and frankly deserve even more from our industry. They can book a hotel anytime day and night, they can book a flight to fly anywhere in the world… but they can’t book a viewing on a house to buy to let? Odd, right? (Personally, I do not consider these so-called game-changing solutions that still require users to wait for confirmation from an agent as instant booking. Instant booking is when a user selects a time the agent or seller is available directly from their diary and once I choose it its booked and confirmed. Done).

Anyway, if you’ve made it past that last paragraph of passionate ranting, then you will want to know how you go about choosing your tech stack to ensure you don’t get it wrong.

It would be wrong for me to sit here and say, “just use this” or “just use that”. Firstly, I have not used every bit of agent tech out there. Secondly, I don’t know you and your agency inside out like you do. All agents are not the same and therefore each tech stack we use will be unique. However, the process we all follow when building our tech stacks will look similar: The obvious core will be your software system (CRM), followed the tools you use to generate leads (such as your website, the portals you advertise on, etc), and then the software you use to report maintenance issues, or help with sale progression, etc.

Remember; you all have a tech stack of some description already. Some agencies will have large, complex stacks and others of you may have just one or two key bits of technology that help you run your business. I recommend sitting down and considering what tools you are using and whether they actually add value to your business, whether that’s helping your clients, saving time, saving you pain (e.g. do they make working easier for you and your team?), can they be integrated with your CRM system or is it a standalone offering? The whole point of reviewing and adding (as well as removing) technology is to improve your business, and help it run more efficiently – if it doesn’t do that it’s not worth it!  Next week I will be looking at the most important piece of proptech in any agent’s tech stack… your CRM system. In the meantime, if you need my advice on technology you are currently using in your business or something you’re thinking of using feel free to drop me a line.

Article of the week:

This week, the following article in the trade press was very interesting:

<a href="http://www.propertyindustryeye.com/will-high-street-estate-agents-make-the-same-mistake-as-hmv-or-face-the-music/
">http://www.propertyindustryeye.com/will-high-street-estate-agents-make-the-same-mistake-as-hmv-or-face-the-music/</a>

It caught my eye and got me thinking about HMV, Woolworths and Blockbuster and how quickly they disappeared from the high street. Countrywide are already worth comparatively next to nothing. I mean, we now live in an age where at the time of writing Countrywide, LSL and Foxtons combined are only worth around 2/3 of the value of Purplebricks. If we fast forward a few years what will our businesses look like then?
