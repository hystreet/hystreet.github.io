Welcome to my weekly blog, helping high street estate agents navigate the plethora of technology offerings and looking at what can actually help or what would hinder agents as we move through a technological revolution within our industry.

That’s the professional intro, the simple version is that there’s a load of technology out there for estate agents, some is excellent, though a lot of it is just plain rubbish. The best of these tools can make our lives easier, improve our businesses and make us more money, the rest frankly are a waste of time. Having had a few bad experiences with the crappy ones it was hard for me to try, or even consider, products that were offered to me afterwards, trust me when I say this was a mistake.

One thing I have learnt while building Hystreet is that a lot of us estate agents are so far behind the techies when it comes to using software and apps to make our lives easier. I will give you an example; there are some really simple and easy tools out there that let us farm our existing data and our old clients in a quick easy manner. This week I am contacting some of my old homeowner clients using technology with a co-ordinated message to see if we can get back through the door for a fresh market appraisal (either them being nosey or actually considering a move). In next Friday’s blog I will be letting you know the results of the campaign, the tools I used, what it cost me to do and most importantly if, and how, it would work for you.

Finally, I will also bring together for you an article or piece of news content that I have found interesting in the last week. Our industry is changing and I hope I can help my fellow agents keep up-to-date on the key issues and hopefully make things slightly easier to digest. Enjoy…

The article was interesting because not only was it published locally, but it was republished again in the national industry press- the big news was “some estate agents will close” I have some news for you, this happens every week and has done so even during the most booming market, put simply the weak will perish, unprofitable agencies close in the same way unprofitable shops close and unprofitable bars do to. It isn’t new, it isn’t rocket science and it isn’t an issue for the majority. That said the dangers of competition and not evolving to deal will an increased threat to agents must not be ignored.

Each week I want to cover an area of estate agency and discuss the available technology offerings I have come across and try and give you my blunt take on what they offer. If any of you want me to look at a specific area or have any questions, feel free to reach out.
