High Street Agents now have the capacity to be packing some serious heat and Online Agents should be worried about it.

I've been a little bit quiet for the last few weeks, I've enjoyed some time off with my daughter, tidied up the garden, gave the 172 some TLC, put that shelf up I said I'd do last month and finally I've spent the last week hoping Coutinho doesn't go to Barca, however that looks like it's going to happen now which is not good.

But anyway, I've been toying with the idea of starting my own business for a while. But then I found Hystreet, a platform that I have always said has been missing from the industry and after speaking to Awais and the team I very quickly realised how much I liked everything about them, the product, the service and the team were all great and this made me want to be part of the project. Luckily thanks to their amazing growth I was able to join them heading up sales and agent relations in the South West and I couldn't be more pleased with my new role, the product is without doubt an absolute game changer.

What Hystreet have done is launch the software which will change the way agents sell property, they have bridged the gap between High Street & Online Estate Agents and finally given those on the High Street the ammo they needed to start firing back against the Online Agents by rivalling the service they provide with their own version of online estate agency, and I'm not talking about sticking it up online and waiting for viewing requests from Rightmove, oh no - this is the real deal. It comes complete with ID checks, offer negotiation and qualification, buyer and seller user accounts, 24/7 appointment bookings, automated emails, payment acceptance and a fantastic looking platform that just oozes class.

I genuinely cannot express what a game changer this will be for agents, and those that get on it early will have the power to command the market in their local area as they will FINALLY be able to offer the best of both worlds, both a traditional service and an online service instead should any potential customers ask for it.

As Hystreet allows valuations as well as viewings to be booked 24/7, as well as allow offers to be made and negotiated back and forth, it is essentially the same as having another member of staff in the office at all times, all for less than 5% of the cost of hiring a member of staff. What's not to love?

Admittedly this might sound a little bit bias, but I loved the product from the moment I saw it for the first time almost 3 months ago and have always sang it's praises, there isn't anything else on the market like it that can offer agents so much for such a small outlay.
