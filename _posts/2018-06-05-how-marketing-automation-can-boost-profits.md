We are mixing things up with the blog from here on out! From now on, we’re bringing in some of the knowledge and experience from other members of the Hystreet team, so we can advise on some great new ways of helping your business.

My name is Dylan, and I’m the lucky one that gets to follow up from Awais’ famous blog posts! Over the next few months you’ll also get more insights from my colleagues Jamie, Ellie, and Josh. Of course, Awais will return occasionally as well.

My role at Hystreet is ‘Digital Strategist’. Essentially, this means I’m responsible for Hystreet’s online presence, including our online marketing strategies and our sales and marketing processes. To get everyone who wants Hystreet up and using it as soon as possible, we use a lot of automation to speed up our processes and make life easier for both our customers, and ourselves. We’ve used it extensively because it saves us man hours, saves us money in marketing campaigns, and gives us peace of mind that everything is being taken care of. Much like the service Hystreet gives our customers!

So, what is the point of marketing automation? Why not just spend time going through these processes manually? Well, Wikipedia says the following:

“The use of a marketing automation platform is to streamline sales and marketing organizations by replacing high-touch, repetitive manual processes with automated solutions. Marketing automation is a platform that marketers use to plan, coordinate, manage and measure all of their marketing campaigns, both online and offline.”


To put it simply, it automates repetitive process and gives you loads of useful data about which messages your customers are engaging with, which you can use for future marketing campaigns (both on the internet and via traditional means such as leafleting, or newspaper ads)

Agents are sitting on a goldmine that most marketers from my background would be dying to get their hands on, I’m sure nearly every agent reading this has a whole bank of data which (if you’ve kept on top of your GDPR compliance bits…) you’ll be able to use to kick start some great marketing automation processes. Here’s some ideas:

I’m sure most of you get your valuations booked in as soon as possible, but usually you’ll have roughly 24 hours between booking and carrying out that appointment. It’s key to keep up communication during this time, as the vendor will likely be seeing other agents or doing more research into the sale of their home. Just a couple of scheduled emails to make sure they have everything you need for the appointment will do a world of good when it comes to keeping your brand in their mind.

If the vendor doesn’t sign up straight away on the valuation, then you can supplement your manual chases and phone calls with emails or SMS messages that reinforce your key USP’s, and hopefully brings that potential lead back over to you. You can even customise the timing on these messages: Maybe you want to chase daily for the first week, and then once a week for the following month? It’s down to what works best for your business.

It’s important when you’re sending out these communications that you’re using messages that your customers will resonate with. One great thing about this kind of targeted marketing is that you don’t have to paint everyone with the same brush; Would a buy-to-let investor want the same messages as a first-time buyer? Would a young family have the same reasons to move as an elderly retired couple? By using more tailored content you’re making customers realise that you’re paying attention to their individual needs and situations, and they’re not just another number in your database. Not only that, but by setting simple automations such as sending them nice little messages on their birthday, or the anniversary of their home move with you, you can remind them how important they are to your business.

In all your messages it is key to remember that no matter who you are communicating with, or when or how you are communicating with them, there is one thing that should remain consistent: your brand. Most agents reading this will realise how important brand presence is when it comes to estate agents – all you need to do is look at the various brands some of the national chains and franchises operate under to see the power a brand can have. Your brand and your key messages & values should never be compromised on, as ultimately this is what stays in the minds of your leads and is why they come to you to sell their home.

Always measure the statistics from every single communication that your customers send out. Just like with traditional marketing, it’s important to see what sticks, and not just in terms of direct revenue. One of the most widespread analytics tools in the world is Google Analytics, and whilst proper techheads can get essentially any data they desire out of it, us mere mortals can still see really important information as soon as you install it, such as what our most effective adverts are in terms of clicks, visits, users, etc, and the journey our typical converted leads tend to take. It’s important to consider, as I mentioned earlier, that customers may not resonate with the same messages. If an email works great for first time buyers, it may not have the same effect with retirees, and vice-versa!

In summary, by setting up a few simple marketing automation campaigns, you can save your team time, and boost your brand awareness 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It’s more flexible than traditional marketing, and allows custom, more personal messaging to every single one of your customers. To be blunt, it’s something no estate agent should shy away from.

So, are you ready to jump in to the wild world of marketing automation? As a first port of call, I would recommend <a href="https://mailchimp.com/">Mailchimp</a>. Awais has discussed Mailchimp on the blog before for its mass email marketing capabilities, but it also allows for nice and easy drag-and-drop automations and handles all the compliance stuff behind the scenes, so you can concentrate on your marketing. If you want to get in a little deeper, <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> is the next place to look. Zapier integrates with thousands of applications, meaning you can work marketing automation across your entire business, and pull data from your entire tech stack without having to write a single line of code!

I hope you found this useful, if you want to discuss any of this with us then please get in touch, and I’ll be happy to lend a hand. Thanks for reading!
