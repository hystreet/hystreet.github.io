This week I was out of the doghouse and busy with the team working on getting the portal feeds sorted again as well as going through upgrades and fixes.

When we launched the Hystreet beta, it was a hard choice. Whether we release the product too late and risk building something that our users don’t like/need, against releasing it too early and risk it being buggy/incomplete. One day I saw this famous quote by Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn, which read: “If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late.”

So, we launched early, we have largely been blessed by the support, patience, and proactive involvement of our beta test agents and now the product is starting to change from a caterpillar into a butterfly. But we have also had agents that wanted it that couldn’t wait as the beta test was extended past the original deadline to further improve the product. As someone who doesn’t like to let people down and being an impatient big kid, this part has been hard for me, but having seen the designs for V2 of Hystreet I’m super excited.

This week I won’t share an article, but a comment I read in response to an article, it read:

“This isn’t the 1950’s we embraced modern technology (internet, email etc) a long time ago before these pay up front online agents came about”.

I honestly read this comment in response to a trade press article this week. Where do I bloody start?  First, internet and email are as “modern” as Pulp’s famous “Common People” song, both of which were “modern” in the mid-nineties (i.e. over two decades ago).

Any agent that thinks having a website and sending emails alone is sufficient, will frankly close their doors very soon. I’m sorry to inform those agents the current landscape has changed, we are no longer in the 90’s, even though the Spice Girls maybe making a comeback soon.

Then onto the second part of the comment which goes on to say regarding pay upfront online agents “they don’t offer anything new apart from being slightly cheaper”.

So, I ask the following questions:

As a potential vendor can I book a valuation online using my mobile device anytime and have it be a confirmed appointment? The many generic plugins that most agents use where they pay a firm to have what’s a glorified form does not count as it doesn’t show me your agents diary and at the end of filling in these generic forms the valuation isn’t confirmed… that’s a shame.As a potential buyer on your website can I book, amend, cancel and feedback on viewings again online and via my mobile device from anywhere in the world at any time…? Didn’t think so.
A client can do these and many other things with virtually any decent online agent and with a growing number of tech enabled high street agents too. What worries me about this comment is that this agent isn’t the only one who thinks this way, I have spoken to many other agents who believe (or at least say they do) that their very basic use of technology is sufficient to secure their survival… I assure you it won’t be. Smart high street agents are embracing the kind of technology onliners have had for the last 3-4 years.

So, this week in my own small estate agency business we decided to undertake a mobile lead generation campaign, essentially, we sent a text message to our database of previous clients to see if we could drum up a few extra market appraisals (valuations).  First, we took our data from our CRM system, crafted a simple but effective message and used a great SMS provider called <a href="https://www.textmarketer.co.uk/">Text Marketer</a>.

The result was an SMS sent by our business to our clients offering them a market appraisal. The key to converting the interest was understanding the client, so we did bunch of A B testing and found the best day and time to get maximum responses (anyone that wants to know the magic day and time or wants a copy of the SMS please subscribe to this blog and get in touch).

We spent 10 minutes exporting the mobile numbers from our CRM. Then it took only around 5 minutes to write and send the message.

In total this campaign took 15 minutes and cost £34.52, giving us a cost per market appraisal of £11.51. The campaign has been successful, and clients didn’t call us once but went through and booked their valuation using the Hystreet valuation engine on our website (currently free but won’t be that way forever).

Next week I will be looking at internal staff communication and how we have reduced the need for our staff to call the office and each other. Have a great weekend, as always, any questions feel free to get in touch.
