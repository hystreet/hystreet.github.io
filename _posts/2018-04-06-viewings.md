This week has been mental, I feel like I spent it on calls doing a lot of talking. At Hystreet we have finally started the finalisation features which is super exciting for me and a couple of our agents (you know who you are). I still struggle with being patient and I love seeing new features that our agents are asking for coming to life. On the estate agency side, it has been a manic week, in Bromsgrove there are around 12 sales agents, this week saw our fighter brand AP Morgan Online (which was setup using Hystreet) move into 6th place. Not bad for a for a few months of hard graft!

Viewings are probably the most underrated part of estate agency, however they are crucial for any modern estate agent and not just for the obvious reasons. For the first quarter of this year I have monitored the source of all our Market Appraisals and I must say I was very surprised to learn that 23% of all the properties we have been out to value this year came directly from a client on a viewing. The art of building rapport and converting a viewer into an appraisal is one that is often overlooked. It can be great way to get more appraisals, and in our case these were all clients that for whatever reason could not be closed at the point of booking a viewing. The reason behind this is simply rapport, people buy into people, trying to get into a house to value it when you haven’t built a relationship or even met the prospect face to face is hard. However, after they have experienced your service and you have built a good rapport on a viewing it’s a lot easier to get that valuation especially if their current agent isn’t as good as you are. Viewings also let you understand your buyers, get to know them and build a more detailed profile of them, their needs and their motivation. In essence a humble viewing is potentially one of the most important parts of estate agency and as agents we must ensure we are doing our best to get the most from them, whether that’s a deeper insight into the buyer’s needs, a valuation from the buyers, a price reduction, constructive feedback for the seller or an offer - the list is endless. In short make sure you do each viewing justice.

##Outsourced Viewings

Given the above you would think that I am totally against the idea of sending no agents to do viewings, and in a lot of cases I am. However, you must consider the fact that aside from the valuation and photo appointments, the main thing stopping us from taking instructions outside our normal patch is the headache and time lost doing viewings miles away. Outsourcing is ideal in that situation. Then there are those bank holidays, Sundays and when you’re short staffed, again outsourcing is perfect to fill those gaps. I don’t think there is anything better than an actual estate agent that knows the property to undertake viewings but we must not be naïve to the fact this isn’t always practical or possible in those situations I think outsourcing is a good next best alternative. If you want a company to do these viewings for you that has the network and is reliable then www.viewber.co.uk is the obvious choice. Another great solution built by an agent for agents.

##Virtual viewings, virtual reality, augmented reality 3D, 4D, Virtual tours etc. are they even worth having?

The traditional way of viewing properties is an inefficient model, for us the agents as well as the potential buyers. So much time wasted seeing all those properties that do not result in a sale or are not suitable for the buyers become a massive burden on time. As a person who watched a multi-million-pound property get bought off the back of a facetime viewing I am totally aware of the power of technology in this space. But that was Dubai, the buyer a Russian investor, and the unit in question was identical to pretty much every other unit in the building, even by Dubai standards this isn’t normal… Yet.

Personally I cannot see the majority of people buying a property in the UK after just seeing it online. I consider virtual viewing enablers of essentially allowing clients to filter out properties they are not interested whilst sat on their sofa at home, do not fear as this will only increase the quality of property viewings, reduce the number of waste of time viewings and increase the efficiency of your teams. I don’t currently use any of the various options out there but I do think that will change later this year, that said I must say I have been impressed by www.eyespy360.com they have put together a solution that clearly is going down well with a lot of respectable agents I have spoken to.  

The world is changing and very quickly this week’s article that caught my eye was this:
http://www.propertyindustryeye.com/land-registry-records-first-digitally-signed-mortgage/
it’s not ground-breaking but it just goes to show quietly and quickly even the most ancient and technophobic institutions are embracing technology, I do feel this era is akin to the industrial revolution and we are living in the technological revolution, the question is; who is still coal powered?

Next week we will take a look at conveyancing, as always if you want to suggest a topic or having any questions feel free to give me a shout.
