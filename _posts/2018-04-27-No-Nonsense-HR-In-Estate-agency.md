This week we’ve been focussing on finalising some of the designs for version 2 of Hystreet, as part of an ongoing process I’ve been talking to our clients and working with Antonio (our user experience guru) to dig further into what we can do as a platform to ensure we keep our agents at the centre of our product.

This brought up an interesting response from one of our clients, he said Hystreet is making his agents’ lives easier and they are happier now that when they were using the old system. He felt the software we are building was helping him retain staff, it’s something that I can honestly say I had never considered but it got me thinking about staff retention and HR in estate agency today.

Across all my businesses, in a career spanning 15 years in property, I have parted company with over 50 members of staff and to be honest it never gets easier. It’s the one thing I hate the most about being the “boss”. Don’t get me wrong, some of them really did deserve it and I had no guilt but the act and process itself is, and has always been, a ball ache I could do without.

Managing an estate agency is hard enough I was busy selling houses and managing people on top of that wasn’t easy. As my business grew I was increasingly becoming bogged down with HR stuff but I’m not an employment lawyer and the regulations are not exactly easy to understand.  I became an estate agent because I love property, not employment law. When I first entered the industry, I decided to use off the shelf contracts, needless to say they weren’t worth the paper they were printed on and I found that out the hard way. Then I thought I would use a “professional”, so I went to my local solicitor, this was akin to going to the dentist about your back pain. After a second painful experience I realised I needed a specialist HR provider and I went with what was described as the market leader, the salesman came out talked a good game convinced me to sign a 5 year contract (I know, as an agent I should have known better) and basically rinsed me for the best part of £500 a month for 5 years. So, what did I get for my money? Off the shelf contracts and a “insurance policy”. They claimed that if I had any trouble then they would cover the costs, perfect? Well not exactly. The way they operated meant a standard dismissal that a specialist would have had wrapped in weeks took over a year following their insured method! This created a toxic working environment and left a bad taste in my mouth.

Your employees are your most valuable assets and if things go sour (as they almost always do with at least one person) you need to be protected. The estate agency sector faces many unique challenges, are the hours you make people work actually legal? How can you stop an employee going to a competitor with your vendors and landlords? Or stop them setting up shop on your patch and poaching your staff (their ex-colleagues)?  These are all concerns many agency managers and owners have pointed out to me and all issues I have faced personally over the years.

The estate agency sector is great for being a shining example where there are no big gender divides and to maintain this it is crucial to ensure that we have fair and consistent policies in place, so that no one is put at a disadvantage – intentionally or by accident. You must make sure that any procedures relating to things such as flexible working and parental leave requests are organised in an easy, impartial way. Its all-important but I don’t want to be doing it myself, yet the responsibility is on me to adhere to the law – like at home with the missus, ignorance is not an excuse and mistakes can be costly!  And I’m not joking, one slip up in regard to equality and you would see the average small-to-medium estate agency having to make uncapped payments for discrimination claims, potentially causing you to go to the wall.

So what can we do? Well I have found my secret weapon and to be honest it’s one of hardest ones to share as I feel I have paid my dues to finally find this company. But in the spirit of giving and hoping my competitors in Redditch and Bromsgrove don’t read this blog I will openly say I use a massively experienced HR lawyer called Wendy. Wendy having been in the industry over 30 years seems to know all there is to know, plus like me, she believes technology is the way forward so her business <a href="https://peoplepointhr.co.uk/">www.peoplepointhr.co.uk</a> is a perfect blend of the two. They have packages to suit all business from a starter product to the Pro which I am a big fan of. The other things about them that I love is that they specialise in estate agency and lettings agency. They cover other businesses but they truly understand our industry. I love what they offer as it’s taken a weight off my shoulders and I have arranged something for you all too so don’t say I don’t look after you, if any of you have any HR issues or have any questions you’re unsure about get in touch with them tell them Awais from Hystreet put you in touch and you will get your own no obligation FREE HR health check!

Next week I want to talk about the increasing importance of post viewing feedback.

This week’s news item that caught my eye is:

<a href="http://www.propertyindustryeye.com/online-agent-emoov-takes-on-high-street-with-launch-of-a-new-homes-services-for-developers/">http://www.propertyindustryeye.com/online-agent-emoov-takes-on-high-street-with-launch-of-a-new-homes-services-for-developers/</a>

Now those of you that are switched on will realise this is a smart move by Russell and the team at Emoov and spells increasingly worrying times for high street agents. But many agents are too worried about arguing the toss on whether fixed fees and upfront payments will survive, only to miss the fact that onliners are coming for a bigger piece of your pie.
