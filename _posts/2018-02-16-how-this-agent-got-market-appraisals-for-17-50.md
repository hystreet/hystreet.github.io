So, I find myself writing this from the doghouse (more on that later). Last week was great, I was on a high with a huge amount of great feedback to this blog from agents all over the country, this week however was a rollercoaster full of ups and downs.

It began with a downer; our portal feed on Hystreet broke let’s just say… It wasn’t a small problem and a lot of people were not happy most of all me! We are in the throes of getting it sorted again but this episode taught me that I have a great team who are more than happy to burn the midnight oil to get our agents up and running again as soon as they can, it also taught me we have great clients who have been super patient knowing the lengths we are going to give them the technology they need to thrive.

Then the up; I met some estate agencies using our product and even though they were hard meetings given some of the issues the system has faced recently like the portal issue, they were great meetings. One stood out the most; I met this team for the first time and to be honest I was blown away with how hungry, switched on and forward thinking they were. I won’t say which firm but what I will say is I met three real people, one of whom was a no nonsense founder who doesn’t mince his words flanked by an experienced well respected industry veteran who knows his stuff both complimented by a young smart technology guy. These guys really gave me a boost and reminded me why I set out on this journey and their patience and understanding showed me that there are some agents out there that do understand building an amazing product isn’t a flick of a switch, this made me even more fired up to go out of my way for this client. That said the estate agency side was just as eventful and we have the results of the valuation generation experiment that I did for you all last week.

Finally, I will also bring together for you an article or piece of news content that I have found interesting in the last week. Our industry is changing and I hope I can help my fellow agents keep up-to-date on the key issues and hopefully make things slightly easier to digest. Enjoy…

I took 3500 old clients details from our CRM system (make sure they have agreed to be communicated by you… I will talk more about GDPR in the coming weeks) and we used a simple bit of technology to send them what was effectively a marketing email. 3472 emails were sent (28 had expired, changed, or had otherwise became invalid since we collected the information) 521 of these opened and read the email, 56 clicked on the link and 2 booked a valuation. These are directly traceable to the email and are in addition to the usual valuations we pick up most days anyway.

So, what did this cost? Well we used MailChimp (<a href="https://mailchimp.com/">www.mailchimp.com</a>) to send out the emails this costs us just under £300 per month, as we use it extensively. If we used it only to nurture these 3500 potential leads then due to MailChimp’s scaling price model it would only cost us around £35 per month. We used the Hystreet book a valuation button (which is currently FREE. It won’t be forever) so in total we spent 10 minutes extracting the email addresses from our CRM, 15 mins setting up the email to go out, and 0 mins booking valuations as Hystreet dealt with that. In short, we manged to generate 2 valuations for a cost of £35 so cost per valuation of only £17.50.

I have attached a copy of email with this email (feel free to “take inspiration” or indeed share any better versions you may use). This week I am going to be doing a similar exercise using mobile communications and will again share my results, the tech used and the exact costs. So in next week’s blog we will go through the results and see which turns out to be the better way of getting called out to market appraisals.

This article caught my eye this week:

<a href="http://www.propertyindustryeye.com/eye-newsflash-yopa-launches-no-sale-no-fee-option">http://www.propertyindustryeye.com/eye-newsflash-yopa-launches-no-sale-no-fee-option</a>

It occurred to me that the onliners are quickly eyeing up the no sale no fee market but us high street guys are still in the large majority (too ashamed to admit we could benefit from offering online services and tap into their market). As a small agent with two branches I am proud to say I for one am and will continue to look at how I can increase listings and revenue including offering an online/hybrid service. So why am I in the doghouse? Well I only went and forgot it was valentine’s day on Wednesday! See you next week by which time I may have made it out of here.
