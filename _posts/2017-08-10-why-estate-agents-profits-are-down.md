Earlier this year major players Countywide and Foxtons published their results and they were significantly down. I'll put a link to the article written by the Telegraph later on which gives the figures, but in this article we're going to look at why.

Evidently, the squeeze is on - office costs are higher than ever, transport costs are going up and up, quality staff are getting more expensive to hire and retain and agents need an answer to deal with it all. A recent article claimed that one in five high street agents are at risk of going bust, but I would argue it's in fact higher than that.

The big boys are blaming Brexit, politics and the position of the moon over the Earth, perhaps in an attempt to keep shareholders and investors happy. But there's a very big elephant in the room.

Too many estate agents are focused on convincing the vendor that they offer the best service and that they can do more that they're completely missing the point of what people want? Your customers are not all the same and there is no one size fits all package anymore.

Some people couldn't care less if you're number one on Rightmove, the car that has sold the most units ever in the UK is the Ford Fiesta, but that doesn't make it the BEST car ever in the UK as that is down to interpretation.

Some people aren't interested in how many years you've been running or how many branches you have either, some people literally just want to sell their house, at the best price and for the lowest fee.

Estate agency is one of the only businesses in history that has never changed from "here's the price, take it or leave it".

None of you are offering choice, I could ring up 10 estate agents at random right now and ask the same question and get the same answer.

Q: "How much do you charge?"

A: "It's X% sir, can we give you a free valuation?"

Not one of them would say "Well it all depends on what level of service you would like sir, we operate a number of different packages to suit all of our customers".

Going back to the Ford Fiesta - the new 2017 model has 11 different models to choose from. Ford already know which model will sell the most, but they give people choice of 11 models because it's what they want. It will be model number 2 (Zetec) that outperforms all of the others, because it offers the best compromise of features for the best price.

Choice is what people want.

Countrywide have noticed this and have now launched an Online/Hybrid service that aims to tackle the online newcomers that are gaining more and more of a foothold in the industry, a far cry from everyone's initial thoughts that online agents weren't here to stick around.

They are giving their vendors a choice between traditional marketing, and the new age of property marketing.

I hear and I see a lot of the same comments every single day; "Why would we devalue our services?" or "Why would we drop our fee to compete?" or my personal favourite, "This is the way it has always been done, and it's the way we're going to do it". I wonder if Blockbuster had similar thoughts when Netflix et al. came on the scene?

Unfortunately, the agents that have the thoughts above are being very narrow minded, the market is changing and customers want to be offered a choice, so by saying "Why would we devalue our services?" You're actually in fact pricing yourself out of a market that is ever increasing and not showing any signs of slowing down.

You don't have to do the same amount of work for a lower fee either, more and more vendors are happy to do more of the work themselves (viewings, offer negotiation etc).

If somebody wants you to take some photographs of their house, write a paragraph about it, advertise it and deal with the enquiries and they'll give you £850 for doing it, then you're bonkers to turn it down. You could probably find someone in your applicant database fairly quickly as well. The opportunity for up sells such as viewings, sales progression, legal and FS are still there so don't think that £850 is the be all and end all, because it isn't.

I get that you may have spent weeks, months and years of hard work to build a traditional estate agency business to whatever level it's currently at, but whether you have 200 branches or you're an independent - the market is changing around you and you can't be blinded by "the way it's always been done". The bigger businesses that lead the way in the industry have seen it first, but you need to adapt - otherwise you will get left behind.
