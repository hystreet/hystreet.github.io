I do not know anything except I do not want to become a dinosaur!

What I have come to realise in my life so far is that I actually have not got a clue what I'm doing. Now this is not because I’m making some lame and transparent attempt to appear humble it’s because it’s true! I'm on a journey, one that I'm enjoying but I don't know where it's taking me, and anyone who thinks they know where there's is taking them is mistaken.

Any person in business or in fact in any aspect of their lives will find themselves on a dangerous road to failure the second they think they know what they are doing, getting stuck in a rut of what you think you know can be catastrophic. We must constantly question our knowledge and plan on the basis that we do not know what we think we know.

Ronald Wayne, one of Apple's co-founders, sold his 10% stake in Apple for $800 two weeks after launch. If he had kept it, it would be worth tens of billions today. Now this decision is an extreme example and is put here without context but is most likely one that hammers the point home.

Socrates said "I know that I know nothing" in order to achieve any level of knowledge, one must first admit his/her own ignorance. So in short, what Socrates was saying is actually the first step in opening yourself up to gaining knowledge. I've done exactly that, and in less than 5 years I've gone from pulling pints in a pub to becoming Regional Manager of one of the most exciting businesses in the UK that very soon everyone in the estate agency industry will be talking about. How? Because I always want to better myself, I always want to learn new things and I am always wondering what's over the next hill.

It's 2017 and I am surrounded by estate agents and property professionals in the UK that are stuck in that rut, the malaise of what they think they know. They have grandiose ideas fuelled by self importance about how they will survive and thrive against the new world of PropTech firms springing up left right and centre. I regularly see and speak to many agents across the country, who all seem united on the notion that technology cannot replace them. Astoundingly they fail to actually grasp the idea of the technological revolution we are currently seeing gain increasing momentum. Technology is not here to offer a cheap no frills functional alternative to a high street estate agent, technology can and will offer a superior service for a lower cost due to efficiency’s and a low costs base than can be offered by a high street agency with the shackles of rent, rates and burgeoning operating costs.

I am from a generation that spent my younger years watching my parents enter a travel agent and book a holiday on the high street, my Dad got his business insurance from the broker up the road from his shop and his solicitor is at the other end of the same street. Now I book my family holiday's using Skyscanner or Expedia, my daughter has a collection of Meerkats from my never ending impulse buys of cars that I need to insure and factory conveyancing in business parks across the country dominate the property related legal services industry.

Like it or not property transactions will go the same way. The difference is the fight will now be between good agents across the country without geographical divides. The fee paying public will benefit as now only the best, most efficient and quality purveyors of services will survive in a environment where only the strongest and most innovative have a chance, the public have the power to choose and review their experiences, we live in a world where a bad review on social media can go viral and make or break your reputation. This means competition is tougher, innovation is constant and services are being added all the time in order to gain a competitive advantage and costs are stripped back as far as economically possible.

Once we accept these facts we will realise that the consumer wins, the quality operators will thrive, estate agents across the country should see this as a real opportunity to do something different and steer their business in a new direction.

Any technological renaissance such as that we are seeing in the UK at the moment is akin to the near apocalyptic natural disasters of history that wipe out the weak and unprepared and gave the strong and innovative forefather the chance to thrive. The next 10 years will truly see the survival of the fittest agents and anyone short-sighted enough to ignore the PropTech revolution will be a fossil confined to history books as an anecdotal footnote like Ronald Wayne (see you forgot him already, he was the chap that sold his 10% in apple for $800).

Accept that you do not know anything and embrace the journey of learning what technology can do for you before you become a dinosaur. Don't stand still, the old you would want to know what's over the next hill. Those that don't will regret it.
