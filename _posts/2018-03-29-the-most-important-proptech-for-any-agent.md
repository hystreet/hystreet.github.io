The single most important piece of Proptech in any estate agent’s business is…

Their CRM. CRM (Customer Relationship Management software) is, in my opinion, the single most important bit of technology that any estate agency will use. Even today in 2018 there are agencies that don’t use a software platform for this, trust me when I say it doesn’t matter whether your business is big or small, new or old, or even what segment of the market you operate in, this is one piece of technology that you shouldn’t live without. The way to approach choosing a CRM, or making sure the CRM you are using is right for you, is quite simple:

1.	Your needs
2.	Your budget
3.	Your team
4.	The three Fs

##Your needs

This one is the easiest of them all; do you need a platform that deals with sales only, or sales and lettings? You may need a full-service platform that takes care of accounts, commercial, etc. or you may not need these features. A server hosted system is fine if you’re only going to use the system whilst sat in the office, but if you think you will need access from outside the office (e.g whilst at home, or out on appointments) via mobile device then a cloud-based system would almost always be best.

##Your budget

This needs to be looked at carefully. Firstly, what can you afford to spend? Many systems charge per user, others by branch, and some in other weird and wonderful ways. Make sure you fully understand what your CRM provider is going to be charging you. Also remember that over longer terms, some platforms (like Hystreet) will drive revenue back into your business so make sure you take that into account as my dream was always to build a platform that put money into  agents’ banks each month rather than take money out

##Your Team

The purpose of a CRM is to help you and your team, so look for a system that helps to alleviate the crappy jobs you and your team hate doing – after all, a happy team is a productive team. By simplifying and automating administrative tasks you can free yourselves up to do your more important jobs. It still astounds me how many agents are still taking the time to do manual ID checks and fact finds when automation these days is advanced enough to give agents their precious time back.

##The three Fs

###Features

Do you need SMS capability from within the system? Reporting? What type of statistics, reports, and team reporting do you need?
It’s wise to sit down with your team and ask yourselves the following:
1.	What features and functionality do you definitely need?
2.	What could you live without? (but would still like to have)
3.	What do you not need?
I will be honest, a lot of CRM systems for estate agents have features you will almost never use. Why pay for a bunch of gimmicky bells and whistles that are essentially distracting noise for you and your team?

###Fit

Consider how well prospective CRM systems fit with your other technology providers. For example, I use <a href="https://www.fixflo.com/">FixFlo</a>, <a href="https://www.goodlord.co/">Goodlord</a> and <a href="https://www.xero.com/uk/">Xero</a> to name a few. (We use a load more too, for more information on building your own tech stack look at my <a href="https://hystreet.co.uk/2018/03/23/estate-agents-making-stacks.html">previous blog</a>). In tech, we use APIs to essentially allow this communication and fit between tech platforms to happen smoothly. Many agents are happy to use standalone systems and that’s fine as there is no one size fits all when it comes to these things. The second fit is a cultural fit, are you happy that your CRM system contract means the provider owns your data? Are you happy using a system that is owned by a portal that you may or may not use? It’s important that your own personal values are reflected in your CRM partner, there are many different CRM systems out there that are effectively all owned by the same group, does this bother you? This is widely overlooked, but who owns your data is becoming a bigger issue (as recent news stories highlight) and is definitely something to consider when entering a long-term agreement or relationship with any technology provider.

###Future

Are there any things that you would like to offer but are not currently doing so? Are there features you would like to see released? It’s essential your CRM listens to what you need and that they understand your business. A lot of the users of Hystreet like the idea they can message me directly on Linkedin or call me up, and they love the fact the system is built by agents for agents. This doesn’t mean it’s perfect, but it means we are constantly listening and improving as we know the challenges you face as we are also facing them daily in our own agencies. A forward-thinking CRM that allows you to future proof your business isn’t just a novelty for younger owners and managers but is crucial for those in the twilights of their careers, as when it comes to selling your business and retiring who wants to buy or take on a firm that is living and working in the past?

In conclusion, the perfect one size fits all system didn’t exist, so I set about trying to build one. I will never achieve that as all your businesses are different and your ways of running them are equally weird and (mostly) wonderful. The above key principles will ensure that you make a logical and sensible decision when it comes to choosing a new CRM provider. Technology trends and the market are changing every day so as always if you need any advice or just an opinion on anything agency or tech related feel free to drop me a line. Next week I’m going to be taking an in-depth look at viewings.

##Interesting article of the week

Interesting article of the week is, hands down, the monster amount of money Purplebricks raised to come after high street agents and take even more listings from us. Essentially, this shows they are not going away and that we must act now and protect our businesses by offering our clients choice within our own services.
