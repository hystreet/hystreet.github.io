I’m sat in a cafe in the Bulgarian Capital of Sofia. It was -20°c this morning and over a foot of snow on the pathways so I have no sympathy for everyone back home in Blighty that have had a comparable dusting of the white stuff and experiencing merely -3°c!

Over the last week despite the cold weather the team at Hystreet have been keeping the home fires burning our new team member Martin A.K.A “Mez” has been rattling through code and the speed at which features & releases are coming out is increasing again which is super.

I have found myself travelling a lot recently; I have noticed in the tech world the idea of remote teams and people working from different places at different times is almost a given. For years techies have found effective ways to work with people in different countries and time zones as effectively or arguably more productively than if they were all sat in an office together.

This week in the U.K. estate agency branches across the country stuck up their A4 paper sign saying snow has stopped play (or in one notable case “gone sledging”) on the door. This had me thinking… as estate agents why does a little bit of snow grind things to a halt? That’s not to say a lot of agents don’t put their phones on divert and carry on working from home, because clearly most of us do. But the bigger issue was the way we communicate internally with our team during normal days, snow days and virtually any other day or night.

When I started out I would rely on my colleague remembering to pass on a message from a client if I was out or on the phone when they called. Later, if I was on viewings I would come back to a desk full of post it notes saying call Mr Jones back etc. A few years ago, emailing me missed calls and messages was the done thing. More recently it was to send an internal message via our CRM system.

All of them worked to some degree or another, then WhatsApp came along. With WhatsApp we could message our colleagues to inform them if a viewing had been cancelled, or an applicant was running late without tying up the phone lines. In fact, the younger team I now had were happier using WhatsApp than emails or internal CRM messaging. Groups in WhatsApp allowed us to make team-wide, branch-wide or company-wide messaging possible. However, I inevitably ended up with certain team members sat on their phones in the office “using WhatsApp for work” (apparently…).

Nowadays in my estate agency branches we use a specific software designed for exactly this type of communications. It has an easy to use mobile app like WhatsApp that means the team get notifications whilst on the move, but in the office it’s all on desktop so no need to have all my team sat on their mobiles anymore! The platform I use also has a robust API (talks to other systems) so I get a message to let me know when someone is off or has annual leave (before the morning meeting), and it also lets the team and I know when a market appraisal is booked on Hystreet. It can easily be configured to alert you and your team of nearly anything at all!

This software has really improved efficiency, communications and has strengthened our team spirit. I consider it amongst my key tech secret weapons (any of you that isn’t a subscriber and wants to know what the secret weapon is please subscribe to this blog and get in touch). I am an advocate of simple and cost-effective technology that can improve parts of our business and life so rarely will I talk about the deeply complex or technical detail of any tech product, of however you wish to do so feel free to get in touch.

This week’s article that caught my eye was this: <a href="http://www.propertyindustryeye.com/sales-progression-costing-more-for-high-street-agents-as-online-firms-fall-down-on-the-job/">http://www.propertyindustryeye.com/sales-progression-costing-more-for-high-street-agents-as-online-firms-fall-down-on-the-job/</a>

This article was interesting as my team are increasingly finding they are having to sales progress certain online agent’s sales to keep the chain together. Next week I will be looking at sales progression and how you can improve and future proof your processes. For now, I’m going to try and make my way back through the snowy streets of Sofia back to my apartment without ending up on my backside again!
