Online estate agency software
    </h1>
    <p>
Hystreet is a fully online, comprehensive online estate agency software that allows your business to offer an online service to your customers whilst also offering additional functionality for vendors, buyers, and agents by automating and streamlining previously unnecessarily complicated processes such as leaving feedback, ID checks, and property fact finds.
    </p>
    <p>
Our system is completely cloud based. This means you don’t have to worry about complicated installations, updates, or system compatibility issues you may have experienced with other products – if you can access the internet, you can use Hystreet. This is true for everyone involved, including your customers. Hystreet is also accessible on most tablets and mobile phones, and offers the full functionality you would experience on a PC. Another benefit of our cloud-based system means that there is no delay when it comes to updates – your business and your customers will always be instantly updated to the latest version of Hystreet, which we are constantly working on to remain up to date with any changes in regulation and compliance.

Hystreet provides your staff, agents, buyers, and vendors with the parts of the system that they need, allowing and prompting each party to complete all the necessary tasks they need to progress the sale. For example, the system automatically chases buyers three times once a viewing has taken place – 2 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the viewing has taken place.

To make sure your sales move forward quickly and smoothly, Hystreet streamlines the process to make life easier for all parties involved. Collecting the details of the seller’s property fact find is done online and submitted by your vendors- all your staff need to do is check the information submitted. We have also partnered with Experian to provide fully automated, online, AML-compliant ID checks, potentially saving your staff hours of time.  These automated and streamlined processes free your staff up to do what they do best – sell houses.
