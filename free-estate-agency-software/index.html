    <p>
Hystreet is a free estate agency software. We charge no monthly fee, no set up charges, and we don’t tie you in to unnecessary contracts. You might think this sounds a bit too good to be true, so carry on reading to discover more about our history and our ongoing plan.

    <p>
Hystreet began development in 2015, when our CEO, Awais Ahmad, noticed a growth in the number of instructions of online estate agents in the towns where his own two independent high street offices are located. He recognised vendors’ growing demand for a convenient online service, but grew weary hearing stories from vendors about how online agents have let them down service-wise. Because of this, Awais decided to act.
    </p>
    <p>
By recruiting a team of tech geniuses, Hystreet was put into development with the goal of providing estate agents cutting-edge technology to not just compete with online agents, but to surpass their capabilities and offer an even better service. During our development we attracted interest from investors from the property and technology industries, and from other industries.

    <p>
Moving forward, the core Hystreet platform will remain free, forever. We will not start charging you for anything you can currently use for free, in fact the capabilities of the core platform will expand and grow at no additional cost to you.
    </p>
    <p>
In the coming months and years, we will roll out and begin to provide a range of additional services and products that we hope your business will find interest in. These services will be priced accordingly and available to all our customers.
