      </p>
      <h3>
        Book appointments online
      </h3>
      <p>
        All appointments can be booked online at any time. Customers can book valuations directly into your agents’ diaries with enough notice to make sure you can still get your comparisons and other pre-valuation preparation out of the way first.
      </p>
      <p>
        They can then book subsequent appointments in the system, including launch appointments. Buyers can then book appointments directly into the vendor’s diary, or the agent’s if they are managing viewings for the customer.
      </p>
            <p>
                    </p>
      <h3>
        Manage sales online
      </h3>
      <p>
        Getting-to-market checks are also handled over the web. We have partnered with Experian® to provide fully AML compliant, automated, online ID checks. These ID checks are submitted by the vendor via our online platform, and only take a couple of minutes to complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system also handles property fact finding, collecting all of the data and documentation needed for the sale in one easily accessible place for your team to approve without the hassle of emails, letters, and scans.
      </p>
            <p>
                    </p>
      <h3>
        Offer negotiations
      </h3>
      <p>
        Offer negotiations happen transparently between the buyer and seller, with position information being made available to the seller on every offer made, meaning they can make an informed decision and get the best deal possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your agents are kept up to date every step of the way, and can still get in touch to help out at any time.
      </p>
            <p>
                    </p>
      <h3>
        Finalising sales
      </h3>
      <p>
When it comes to the last stages of the sale the system continues to save you and your team time throughout the process.       </p>
      <p>
        Information of buyers’ and sellers’ legal representatives is collected, as are additional chain details if needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system also collects documentation and proof of funds, including mortgage approval documents and proof of cleared funds.
